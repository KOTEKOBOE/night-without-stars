# yet another useless todo list

in sake of deploying it somewhere for free so i can enter it from phone while laying in my bed

Made so far:
- broken theme changing
- fetch random stuff for test purposes
- save list to local storage

Things to improve:
- list sharing (at least save it to file)
- llist of completed todos
- existing todos changing
- changing todo position in list
- better responsivity
- confirm removing
- clean button
- better styling (change id selectors to classes)
and many more
